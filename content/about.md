Hello! I'm a second year CS student at the University of the Philippines Manila. My plan is to be a software engineer after I graduate two years from now.

## A little trivia about my name
{{< highlight go >}} String name = "Bermylle"; // Before + Millenium {{< /highlight >}}

I was named Bermylle because I was born in December 30, 1999. They told me it was "before millenium," hence, Bermylle.

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to make this blog site with [Blogpaper](https://themes.gohugo.io/blogpaper/) as the theme.
