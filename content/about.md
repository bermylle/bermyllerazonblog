Hello! I'm a second year CS student at the University of the Philippines Manila. I'll try to keep this site update as often as I can. The topics I will upload here would be mostly about software development and my experiences.

If you want to contact me you can email me at bermylle@gmail.com

{{< highlight go >}} String name = "Bermylle John";{{< /highlight >}}

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to make this blog site. The theme is [Blogpaper](https://themes.gohugo.io/blogpaper/).

<!-- Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/russross/blackfriday
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremelly fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
