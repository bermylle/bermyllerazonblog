Hello! I'm a second year CS student at the University of the Philippines Manila. My plan is to be a software engineer after I graduate two years from now.

## A little trivia about my name
{{< highlight go >}} String name = "Bermylle"; {{< /highlight >}}

I was named Bermylle because I was born in December 30, 1999. They told me that the meaning of my name was "before millenium," hence, Bermylle.

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to make this blog site with [Blogpaper](https://themes.gohugo.io/blogpaper/) as the theme.



<!-- Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/russross/blackfriday
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremelly fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
