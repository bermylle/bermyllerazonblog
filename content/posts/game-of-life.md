This is the first project I did in CS 11. When the project's specification was uploaded on our facebook group, I started straight away because I was a nerd and I considered it as my passion (happy much). I coded nonstop in my dorm and since it's my first project, I thought it was gonna be fun until I was introduced to pointers and arrays.
